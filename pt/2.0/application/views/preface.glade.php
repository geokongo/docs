                <p>The Gliver MVC Framework is for PHP developers, both new and seasoned to write cutting edge web applicaitions, APIs, Web Services, Software Back ends and much more just in a matter of minutes. 
                This framework is inspired by a community of developers who needed a light weight framework with a relatively faster execution time on the server as compared to other frameworks based on <a href="http://php.net/releases/5_4_0.php"> <strong>PHP >=5.4</strong> </a>. Gliver comes with a built in
                templating engine that removes all the monotonous repeated php tags, therefore being less scary for a front end developer with almost no learning curve</p>
                       



                <h3 id="quick_start" class="text-danger">Quick Start</h3>




                <p>To get started with Gliver MVC , you need a runing web server then <a href="https://github.com/gliver-mvc/gliver">download</a> the source code. You might choose to use 
                the various distributions of Apache, depending on your operating system and that would suffice. No special software or environment will you need again to use this framework.  </p>
                <p>Once you have downloaded the source code, extract it into the root directory of your web server and access the application vai a web browser, specifying the name of your installation directory, and there you go! Wish you a happy coding experience after...</p>
                <p>For example, let's say you extracted your code into a folder in your web root called <code>gliver</code>, you access via your url in this manner <code>http://localhost/gliver</code> </p>
      In order to add a package for installation inside Gliver, use composer. Add the package as a dependancy on the <code>composer.json</code> file in your root directory as follows:
<pre>
{
    "require": {
        "vendor/package": "1.3.2",
        "vendor/package2": "1.*",
        "vendor/package3": "^2.0.3"
    }
}                
</pre>
                after this you can run a <code>composer update</code> to download and install package contents. NOTE that you need to have composer installed on your local computer if you would like this to work. There is a more in depth guide on how to use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer </a> and <a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">Packagist</a>  repositories on the respective sites.
